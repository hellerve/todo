# todo

My list of big To-Do items. All of them are more or less pipedreams, although
I’ve spent some time working on some of them.

You can also look at [my reading list](https://github.com/hellerve/ptolemy).

I might need a few decades to kick some of these off of the list.

## Software

These are some pieces of software that I want to write.

* [medium] Build a time and date library and datatypes for Carp
* [medium] Build a HTTP parser and datatype for Carp
* [medium] Investigate how to make Carp compile to WebAssembly with JS integration
* [big] Investigate dependent types in Carp
* [medium] Make the macro system for Carp finally respect hygiene
* [medium] Write a small, self-contained JIT framework in C or Carp
* [medium] Write a small PoC language that handles types and effects separately (effects are
  annotations that let you answer questions about the PoLP of those functions)
* [huge] Build a nanopass compiler framework in zepto, for zepto ([WIP](https://github.com/zepto-lang/zepto/tree/master/zepto/compiler))
* [big] Write a good, display-agnostic framework for pretty-printing in Carp
  (based on [The Final Pretty Printer](http://davidchristiansen.dk/drafts/final-pretty-printer-draft.pdf)?)
* [huge] Build a good standard library for Carp
* [gargantuan] Write a great, Smalltalk-style development environment for Carp,
  a static language (no, really)
* [big] Write an OMeta implementation in OCaml, for learning purposes

## Books

These are some books I want to write. No, really.

* Read, Eval, Print, Loop: A philosophical, historical, and technical
  examination of each of the four stages of a REPL.
* Building a Language: An examination of the tools that you’d usually not
  consider when building a language (development environments; pretty printers:
  a good, clean standard library; etc.)

## Learnings

These are some things I want to learn, ideally in an university setting. I doubt
I’ll be able to ever go back to university, alas.

* Medium to advanced mathematics
* Basic economics
* German Law
* Linguistics and languages (I need to brush up on my French and Spanish, and
  learn Swedish properly)
